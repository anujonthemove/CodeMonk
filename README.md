> My solutions for all kinds of online judges are listed below. Let's say you want to view the answer to **_"count-divisors"_** problem on **_Hacker Earth_** online judge (https://www.hackerearth.com/). You can find out that the **_problem name_** for this specific problem on Hacker Earth is **_count-divisors_**. So the solution to this problem is the file named **_"count-divisors.cpp"_** in the **_"solutions/hackerearth/"_** directory of this project. The same goes with other online judges like Hacker Rank etc.
